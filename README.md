## Features

- Add projects' repositories and show the commits you want to the client, displaying the required info, like the commit's hash, message, or date.
- Once the project was added, run a command to sync it. The sync process will use the commit's hash to check if exists. So you can change the message and the commit will not be overridden in the next sync.
- Preview each commit before publishing it, modify it's message, add a comment or a description.
- Send notifications to your clients when a change is published.
- Clients can make general requests, like Github's issues.
- Clients can make commit specific requests.
- Includes a issue tracking system, which can or not be linked to a commit.
- Add a preview link to the project host.
- Open and close issues whenever you want.



## Installation

Like any other Laravel package, it can be installed through composer by running
